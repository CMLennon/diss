# Chapter 2
## What can we machine learn (too much of) in 2SLS?

---
# What is Two-Stage Least Squares?

- a specific, computational, approach to the *Instrumental Variables* (**IV**) identification problem.

--

**IV problem** Causal Effect, `\(X \rightarrow Y\)` is confounded by some unobserved variable, but there exists some `\(Z\)`, such that `\(Z \rightarrow X\)` and  `\(Z \perp \!\!\! \perp Y | X\)`

Best understood through example: 

**Card Instrument**: Card (1995) `\(^t\)`.footnote[t: 1995. “Aspects of Labour Economics: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp.” In. University of Toronto Press.] interested in the returns to schooling `\(Schooling_i \rightarrow Income_i\)`, but `\(Parent\ Income_i \rightarrow Schooling_i\)` and `\(Parent\ Income_i \rightarrow Income_i\)`. 

 - Solution: Use binary *birth proximity* to a college campus as instrument for schooling.

Single continuous instrument idea: the .hi[continuous instrument] causes a change in some .hi-orange[dose response] for treatment.

Extending the previous: Want to estimate the effect of schooling on income, but would prefer to use intensive margin effect of distance on schooling.

`$$\small ParentalIncome_i \rightarrow Schooling_i$$`

# Nonlinear?

Suppose the true effect is driven by how many college fliers you see (eg, a nonlinear function of distance)?

--

- If we know the function - we can use it directly as we did above (instrument using `\(f(z)\)`)!

--

- Following our usual procedure in the presence of nonlinear functional forms substantially weaken instruments, and bias resulting estimates.

# ML in 2SLS

A promising angle:

- using a functionally appropriate ML tool might be able to boost the strength of a weak or set of weak instruments in the first stage if they are only weak .hi[linearly].

--

Despite the interest, much of the intuition from existing econometric methods doesn't map directly to using Machine Learning for causal queries.

--

**Q** How does using out-of-the-box machine learning perform when predicting the first stage of 2SLS?

--

**A** __(Our Contribution)__ Predicts `\(X\)` well, but the resulting `\(\hat{\beta}\)` is biased in interpretable ways.

---
# Intuition

Much of the assumptions around the first stage of 2SLS center around optimizing two narratives

--

1. Relevance, ie, that your instrument has explanatory power ✅

--

2. Exogeneity, which is generally spoken about in terms of correlations, ie, `\(corr(u,\textbf{z}) = 0\)`.

--

Machine learning, on top of these canonical concerns, complicates exogeneity and introduces two more challenges.

---
# Intuition

Using .hi-purple[machine learning] introduces new concerns:

-  Potentially Recovering endogeneity - overfitting, just as in any prediction task, is doubly dangerous in causal estimation

-  Complex Exclusion restrictions - The set of exclusion restrictions under consideration is much larger. Instead of  `\(corr(\varepsilon_i, \textbf{z}) = 0\)`, need `\(E(\varepsilon_i|\textbf{z}) = 0\)`.

-  Increasing Bias - Bias-variance tradeoff can lead to inflated coefficients in the second stage of 2SLS if variance-reduction is primary strategy.

These factors make using machine-learned first stages tricky to fit into existing causal frameworks.

.center[We run a .hi-orange[monte-carlo simulation] on Belloni et al. (2012) synthetic datasets]

.hi[Result]: using machine learning under classic assumptions can lead to .hi[more bias] than naive-OLS.

---
# Decomposition of Error

Bias in 2SLS breaks down into an informative form-

`$$\frac{Cov(\hat{x}, w)}{Var(\hat{x})} = \frac{\beta_1Cov(\hat{x},e) + Cov(\hat{x},u)}{Var(\hat{x})}$$`
--

- In OLS, `\(\beta_1Cov(\hat{x},e)\)` is mechanically 0, allowing for `\(Cov(\hat{x},u)\)` to be assumed 0 given the estimating model.

--

- .hi-orange[However], the ML estimate of the first stage does not necessarily find `\(Cov(\hat{x},u) = 0\)`.

--

- Additionally, nonlinear first stages can produce non-orthogonal errors, meaning `\(\beta_1Cov(\hat{x},e) \neq 0\)`

Let's return to the toy example from before.

#Discussion

__Conclusion__

- Improvements in first stage fit from out of the box machine learning will often not improve estimates of `\(\beta\)` in the second stage

- In fact, flexibility appears to increase the chance of fitting bad variation into the model, and puts even more pressure on the assumptions made on the data

- This extends beyond just 'forbidden regression'

__However__

New techniques are being developed explicitly to incorporate machine learning into causal pipelines, some of which come with minimal technical overhead if you are willing to accept more restrictive assumptions.

# Research Goal

.center[**Question:** How do fire managers allocate suppression costs?]

--

 Currently: FS uses .hi-orange[Stratified Cost Index (SCI)] which predicts per-acre suppression cost elasticities from past fires.
 
 - Uses ignition point DEM, fuel model, and .hi[total property value] within 20km in log-log OLS framework.
 
 
--

**1.** Is property .hi[value] a valid _causal_ predictor in fire suppression effort/costs?

**2.** If not, what are the consequences of using this variable in the cost function on estimated cost and transporting estimates from Forest Service lands to other locations?

 - does this influence fire manager decisions?

---
# Why the SCI?
&lt;br&gt;
Historically, wildfire suppression costs went *unmonitored.*

--

The .hi-orange[Stratified Cost Index], or .hi-orange[SCI] developed in 2007 by a group of economists under the Bush admin to correct this gap. Big econometric (and accounting project.)

**SCI** addresses need: time-invariant (ignoring inflation) cost predictions of wildfire.

--

 - **Idea**: Rather than perform cost-benefit analysis, the **SCI** provides historic context for fire suppression costs, given local features (fuels, elevation and .hi[property values]) relevant to fire spread and costs.

---
#How the SCI?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**SCI Approach:** regress *point of ignition* characteristics *relevant to fire spread/local assets at risk* on historic fire suppression costs `\(\rightarrow\)` predict new wildfire expenditures.

--

 - .hi-black[Problem]: This procedure assumes only local effects drive fire behavior, but are property values invariant to distant physical features?

---
# Causal Assumptions

Like many observational studies, the .hi-orange[SCI] relies on _conditionally_ as good as random variation.

- Where `\(Y\)` is an outcome of interest, `\(z\)` is a treatment variable and `\(X\)` is a set of controls, assumptions for the identification strategy are:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + z\beta_1 + X\gamma+ u_i \tag{*} 
$$

$$
z \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} u|X \tag{1}
$$
$$
P(z|X) \geq 0 \tag{2}
$$
--

This is a **strong assumption**

---
# Causal Assumptions
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$$
Y = \beta_0 + z\beta_1 + X\gamma+ u_i \tag{*} 
$$

$$
z \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}}u|X \tag{1}
$$

OLS and ignition-level measures of important variables are unlikely to be a sufficiently rich `\(X\)` to satisfy assumption (1).

- Using every observation of spatially-varying controls make the problem ill-posed, many more individual square feet than wildfires in the United States.

# SCI and Income More Correlated?

&lt;br&gt;

We can use correlation between reported `\(SCI\)` final costs and the `\(SCI_{nn}\)` final costs to see if conditioning predictions directly on property value leads to predicted costs that are more correlated with income.

`$$H_0: corr_1(SCI, Income_{20km}) &lt;= corr_2(SCI_{nn}, Income_{20km})$$`

--

`$$p(H_0|corr_1 = .10, corr_2 = .03, n = 424) \approx 0.029$$`
--

Tests on correlation between **property value, per-capita income and summed income** also reject in equivalent tests.

--

.hi[Hard to interpret:] know that the CCT forecast pearson coefficient is smaller, but no guarantee of better outcomes.

# Do Fire Managers Respond to Costs?

.center[&lt;img src="RDD.png" style="width: 100%", class="center"/&gt;]


---

# Conclusion
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 - Once adjusting for non-invariant environmental factors, .hi[property values] appear to have an extremely small (insignificant) effect on suppression costs
 
--

 - Some evidence that .hi-orange[fire managers] respond to this modeling choice, and has some impact on behavior.

--

- Model proposed here is significantly less correlated with per-capita income, summed income and total property value near the point of ignition.

# Term 1

__4 General Cases__

In estimating `\(\beta_1Corr(\hat{x},e)\)`, econometrics has a very limited 'intuitional toolbox' because this term drops out of standard OLS.

--

The effect on bias can be digested into `\(Sign\{\beta_1\} \cdot Sign\{Corr(\hat{x},x)\sigma_x - \sigma_{\hat{x}}\}\)`

--

Quickly noticable is that if the ML algorithm perfectly reproduces estimand `\(x\)`, this term is not of concern. Similarly, if our causal parameter of interest is equal to 0, we are not concerned.

--

If we define a variance reduction strategy as `\(min_{\hat{x}}\ \sigma_{\hat{x_s}},\ \hat{x_s} \in \hat{X}\ s.t. Corr(\hat{x_s}, x) &gt; Corr(\hat{x}_{-s}, x, x)\)`, variance reduction causes problems at a ridge of fixed points that changes with the explanatory power of the algorithm &amp; `\(\sigma_{\hat{x}}\)`

---
# Term 2

`$$Cov(\hat{x},u)$$`

.hi-purple[Exclusion Restriction]. Since OLS is linear in form, requires `\(Cov(\textbf{z}\hat{\beta}, u) = 0\)`, but ML requires `\(Cov(f(\textbf{z}), u)\)` for any arbitrary functional form `\(f\)`.

--

This term leaves the practitioner with one of three tough choices

--

1.) Restrict the functional form of the ML procedure

--

2.) Extend the "Exclusion Restriction" 

- If we can believably strengthen `\(corr(\textbf{z}, e) = 0\)` to `\(E(e|\textbf{z}) = 0\)` then we are safer.

--

3.) Make big assumptions about ML's relationship to excludibility.

---
#Term 3

`$$\frac{1}{Var(\hat{x})}$$`

Variance reduction, typically, is not a concern in 2SLS (though OLS does reduce variance) because our intuitive assumptions about the numerator are that it will be 0.

--

In PLR-based.hi[*] .hi[MLIV], many applications rely on a convergence approach to identification, and thus can result in an almost-IV situation outside of optimal conditions. In these cases, variance reduction can lead to higher-than-naive bias.

# Datasets

**2 Main Datasets**

`\(\text{Number of Obs.}= 1000\)`. Differ only in number, strength and correlation of instruments.

$$
Z_i \sim N(0, \Sigma)\\
X_i = Z_i\gamma + u_i\\
Y_i = 1*X_i + u_i + \varepsilon_i
$$
Where case 1 (easy): `\(|\{z_1, \dots, z_N\}| = 7, \Sigma \equiv \text{diag. matrix}, \gamma =1\)`

And case 2 (hard): `\(|\{z_1, \dots, z_N\}|  = 100, \Sigma \not\equiv \text{diag. matrix},\ \gamma = [.7^1, \dots, .7^N]\)`

`$$P(X_i) = f(\cdot): \text{Treatment Propensity/Treatment Intensity}$$`

`$$\mu(X_i) = g(\cdot): \text{Conditional Outcome}$$`


Where `\(X_i\)` is a set of tabular and raster controls.

Estimate the following system of equations following Frisch Waugh Lovell (ish).

# D/DML Meta-Models

&lt;br&gt;
For wildfire suppression effort `\(i\)`...

`$$log(Suppression\ Costs_i) = \theta log(Property\ Values_i) + g(X_i) + u_i\ \ \ (1)$$`

`$$log(Property\ Values_i) = f(X_i) + v_i\ \ \ (2)$$`

&lt;!--$$\small \theta \equiv param\ of\ interest, \ X \equiv \{Rsk, Envr, Amn, Ex.Supp\}, \eta \equiv\{f(X_i),g(X_i)\}$$--&gt;

Estimating `\(\theta\)` with linear estimators in this system of equations produces estimation error in `\(f\)` in equation (2) that may produce bias

# D/DML

&lt;br&gt;

__Q__ How is this different from controlling for regression inputs?

--

__A__ Buys independence from all functions of inputs that are estimable by the machine learning model.

**Regardless** of how fire managers respond to changes in fire risk/attributes, the model ought to capture that behavior so long as it is observed in the dataset and driven by causal logic.

Remember - there is no certifiable evidence that our fire managers are behaving optimally. Only assumption - they face the same inputs/outputs as an 'optimal' fire manager

---
# D/DML

__Q__ How is this different from controlling for regression inputs?

__A__ Buys independence from all functions of inputs that are estimatible by the machine learning model.

**Important:** This is more than linear OLS specifications, but it's substantially less than everything.

Implicit assumption - The estimation problem given to the ML model can converge to conditional outcome. 

Bias/Variance Tradeoff here is much different calculus than in a traditional prediction problem:

Takeaway - must ensure model is unbiased, at cost of higher variance. More than just *best predictor.*

# Problems

Economists are always interested in 'who benefits' from the provision of any public good, but the .hi-orange[SCI] wasn't meant to do that.

- One takeaway from SCI: fire suppression costs are **caused** in part by total nearby property value.

 - Some researchers interpret .hi-orange[SCI] coefficients on 'sum of property values close to ignition' as **empirical** evidence of optimal suppression effort..super[.orange[*]]
 
 .footnote[.hi[*]: Donovan et al, 2004, Abt 2009, Gude 2013, Hand 2014...]
 
--

Fortunately, wildfire suppression costs are likely valid under .hi[exchangability] and .hi-orange[counterfactual consistency] with a sufficient set of controls.

--

.hi-orange[SCI] controls for environmental and topological factors at point of ignition, so this is reasonable if no included variables' dgp is impacted by location. 
--
.hi[Property value] likely violates this assumption.

# Implicit Assumption of SCI: Invariance

# What does the kernel Look Like?

Pretty hard to figure out, with as many inputs as we have, what actually matters.

--

Harder still - these functions are not linear. How do we get interpretable 'coefficient equivalents'? How about partial gradients?

`$$\hat{\beta}_{nonlin} \equiv \frac{\partial f}{\partial X_i}*X_i$$`

Shown: good performance across interpretability metrics in lab settings.

However - if we have very 'flat' gradients...

`$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial X_i} \approx 0$$` 

...we only have local information about the activation 

- could be flat because at peak of mountain (meaning it's really important to the function) or may be flat everywhere.

---
# Kernel, improved

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Good news: Because Neural Networks are differentiable everywhere, I can use a very cool tool to explore what I'm controlling for in full.

Known as 'integrated gradients' essentially it calculates an approximate Riemann sum of gradients to get true conditional value, following the Gauss-Legendre formula.

---
# Visualizing the Kernel

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

`$$IG := (x_i - x_i') \times \int^1_{\alpha = 0}\frac{\partial NN(x_i' + \alpha*(x_i - x_i'))}{\partial x_i}$$`
Where `\(x_i\)` is an image, but practically speaking could be as fine-grained as a single channel-pixel.

--

This buys me an 'explainability' map over the features I put into the CCT, and allows me to point you directly at what the meta-learner uses to adjust treatment propensity and outcome level.
